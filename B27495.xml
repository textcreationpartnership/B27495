            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>THis Excellent Physitian, whose great skill and good success hath been proved in Curing the most deplorable distempers incident to men or women (as hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds can witness which have been left by other Physitians, and have dispared of their Cure, he having much experience both in the operative and administrative part of physick, and been long practised in the most difficult distempers) hath by the blessing of God attained to the Cure of these Distempers following.</p>
            <p>He hath an excellent secret which infa<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ibly Cureth the venereal distemper called the <hi>French Pox,</hi> with all its attendants, though never so long standing: He fluxes none, nor gives any Mercury-Medicines, for he doth Cure even those that have been sweated and fluxt six or seven times, and makes those happy that have not had one good nights rest in three or four years by reason of dolorous pains when they have been warm in their beds. Therefore let no person be ashamed to disclose their distemper because of long continuance, for never any had this secret way of Cure.</p>
            <p>He taketh away all sordid humours occasioned by the small-Pox or French distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as Running of the Reins, pain in making of water and sharpness of Urine.</p>
            <p>This disease hath several symptomes, for sometimes it will lie with great pains in the head, arms, shoulders, shin-bones, with sore throats, with ulcers in the mouth or palat, as scabs, pustulaes, breakings out in head, face, or neck, nodes or knots on the shin-bones, by which many families are ruined in not understanding what their distemper is; sometimes it will break their rest after they are warm in their bed, with pains: He doth Cure so privately, and so secretly, without any ones taking notice of it, though never so neerly concerned, all Venereall distempers or relapses, that a man shall not perceive it by his wife, nor the wife by her husband, and so perfectly, that it shall never break out again. This he doth with a very pleasant Cordiall Medicine in which is no danger, that kills the poyson of the <hi>Pox</hi> in the bloud, without fluxing, or giving one grain of Mercury, therefore tarry not too long till you are spoiled by others; this is sufficient for such as love their health, and will not willfully cast away the means which God hath sent. And for any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that lives not here, they need not upon that account miss his assistance, for he can send them such proper Medicines that they may Cure themselves, to the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Patient. He will not promise more then he can perform, but will confirm in actions what he relates in words. He Cureth the Scurvy, Dropsy, Consumption, Feavers, Agues of all sorts, the Griping of the guts, Winde and Worms, Ulcers, Swellings, he Cureth the Stone in the bladder, the gravel in the Kidneys. He Cureth the Green-sickness, and opens all obstructions belonging to women, making the womb fruitful of those that are barren, making them joyful mothers. He Cureth the Rickets in Children, and taketh away all redness of the face, as tetters, ringworms, morphews, freckles and heat. Therefore come to me for your own good, and lose not this Bill, lest you be deceived by those that pretend so much, and do so little, now being the best time of the year: neglect not your own health since God hath been pleased to send a means for all those that will embrace it.</p>
            <p>This Doctor liveth in <hi>Salisbury</hi>-street in the <hi>Strand,</hi> between the two Exchanges, at the Signe of the Hand and Sheers, next door to Hermophrodites Tavern, where you may finde him certainly from one a Clock in the afternoon till eight at night; and every day (God willing) at his Chamber in <hi>Hounsditch,</hi> at the Signe of the golden Cock in the Hoop, over against the Nags-head, from eight in the mornin<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> till Twelve at noon; where you shall see this Bill pasted over the door.</p>
